        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Completed schooling in [Your School Name, City].</li>
            <li>Dreamed of becoming a healthcare professional since a young age.</li>
            <li>Gave the NEET exam 3 times before choosing BSc Nursing as my path.</li>

        <h2>Struggles & Triumphs</h2>
        <p>
            My path was never easy. After finishing my schooling, I was determined to become a doctor and attempted the NEET exam three times.
            Even though I faced setbacks and failures, giving up was never an option for me. Each attempt made me stronger, taught me resilience, and helped me discover my true passion for nursing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I'm proud of my journey, and I believe every struggle has made me a more compassionate caregiver.
